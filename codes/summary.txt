The code works a CRBM as mentioned in "Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification
using convolutional deep belief networks" by Lee et. al 2009. The matlab code here is modified 
from the original version to improve speed by removing certain conditions and doing memory
pre-allocation. 

The function get_poshidprobs.m extracts the P(h=1|v) where v is the input visible layer - which is
the decorrelated spectrogram of the audio file. The inputs to the function are:
> speechpath - path to audio file
> W - weight matrix 
> hbias_vec - bias weights of the hidden units
> pars - struct with model and training parameters
> spacing - - local neighbourhood size for max-pooling
